**BPI Sandbox — Datawave 2025**

Financial literacy starts young — building the next generation of empowered savers.

BPI Sandbox is a gamified financial learning app designed for Filipino children aged 7–14. The platform simulates a child-friendly banking experience where kids can earn, save, spend, and learn within a guided environment, while parents monitor progress and assign tasks.

Our Datawave 2025 submission demonstrates how gamification and dual interfaces can bridge the gap between early financial education and formal banking products like BPI Jumpstart.

**Problem Statement**

In the Philippines, millions of children grow up without early exposure to financial literacy or banking experiences. By the time they reach adulthood, many are unprepared to manage savings, budgeting, or borrowing responsibly.

While BPI Jumpstart provides banking tools for teens, there is a missing bridge for children aged 7–14—a critical stage where habits are formed. Without guided learning, families in underbanked communities are unable to expose children to responsible money management early on, perpetuating cycles of financial exclusion.

**Solution: BPI Sandbox**

Sandbox provides a financial playground where children can experience earning, saving, and spending in a safe, gamified environment. Parents play an active role by assigning tasks, monitoring progress, and reinforcing financial habits.

**Core Features**

Dual Interface – Separate optimized experiences for kids and parents

Task Delegation – Parents assign chores or missions, kids complete and track rewards

Savings Goals – Children set goals and visualize progress toward them

Gamified Learning – Badges, levels, and interactive learning cards

Mobile-First Design – Simple, touch-friendly navigation for kids

**Target Audience**

Primary Users

Children (Ages 7–14): Build saving and spending habits in a guided, gamified environment

Parents/Guardians: Monitor activity, assign tasks, and track progress

Secondary Users (Future)

Schools & LGUs: Integrate Sandbox into financial literacy campaigns and community education initiatives

**Future Vision (Track Alignment)**

BPI Sandbox is built as a foundation for Track 2: ESG+E2 — Financial Inclusion & Sustainable Business Growth. Future development will align with hackathon goals through:

Agentic AI for personalized financial guidance tailored to each child’s behavior

Inclusion metrics to identify underbanked families and communities most in need

Ethical microfinance pathways for teens transitioning from the simulation to real accounts

ESG-linked financial literacy modules introducing concepts of sustainable finance and responsible decision-making

**Key Success Metrics**

Engagement: Frequency of logins, task completion, savings goal tracking

Learning Retention: Quiz scores, concept mastery, badge unlocks

Parental Adoption: % of parents assigning tasks and reviewing reports

Inclusion Reach: % of users from public schools or underbanked areas

Pathway to Jumpstart: Number of children transitioning to actual BPI accounts
