BPI Sandbox — Financial Learning App

Building the future of financial inclusion — one child at a time.

BPI Sandbox is a gamified financial learning app designed for Filipino children aged 7–14, with a parallel parent-facing interface for guidance and oversight. The app simulates earning, saving, spending, and learning in a safe digital environment, preparing kids for future products like BPI Jumpstart and fostering lifelong financial literacy.

This project is our official submission for BPI Datawave 2025, under Track 2: ESG+E2 — Financial Inclusion & Sustainable Business Growth.

Problem Statement

Millions of Filipino children grow up without exposure to financial education or safe banking experiences. By adulthood, many are unprepared to manage savings, budgeting, or borrowing responsibly.

While BPI Jumpstart supports teens, there is a missing bridge for children aged 7–14, a formative stage when lifelong money habits are developed. Families in underbanked communities face even more barriers, resulting in generational financial exclusion.

Solution: BPI Sandbox

BPI Sandbox provides a dual-interface digital playground:

For kids: a gamified platform to complete tasks, set goals, and learn financial basics.

For parents: a monitoring and task-assignment dashboard that encourages involvement in their child’s financial education.

The prototype demonstrates how gamification and family engagement can build strong foundations for early financial literacy and inclusion.

Core Features (Prototype)

Dual interface for child and parent users

Task assignment and completion flow

Savings goal tracking and progress visualization

Gamified learning experience with cards, quizzes, and badges

Mobile-first design with touch-friendly navigation

Future Vision (Track Alignment)

While the prototype focuses on the user journey, BPI Sandbox is designed to evolve into a fully track-aligned solution under Track 2: ESG+E2 — Financial Inclusion & Sustainable Business Growth:

Agentic AI for Personalized Learning: Adaptive financial guidance tailored to each child’s behavior and goals.

Inclusion Metrics: Tools to identify and target underbanked communities most in need of early financial literacy.

Ethical Microfinance Pathways: Transition older users into entry-level accounts or microfinance opportunities.

ESG-Linked Education: Modules that introduce sustainable finance concepts, helping families understand responsible financial choices.

Children (Ages 7–14): Build saving and spending habits in a guided, gamified environment.
